## Vibe & Aesthetic (THE NEW DIRECTION)
- **Core Concept**: "The Roadside Smokehouse."
- **Background**: Use the `pexels-wood-texture.jpg` heavily. The whole site should feel like you are reading a menu sitting at a wooden picnic table.
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: **Rusted Orange** (#BC4B00) - used for buttons, borders, and bold text.
  - Background: The provided wood texture.
  - Text: Dark Brown (#2A1A10) for readability on wood, or Off-White on dark cards.
- **Graphics & Decor**:
  - Use **"Cattle Brand" style iconography**.
  - We want a Rooster, a Flame, and a Pig silhouette used as **faded background watermarks** or "stamps" on the wood.
  - They should look like they were burned into the wood or stenciled on.

## Visual Strategy (The Styrofoam Fix)
- The food photos are in styrofoam containers.
- **Do not hide this.** Embrace it.
- Display the food photos with a subtle "drop shadow" so they look like they are sitting on the wooden background.
- Make the menu look like a paper ticket taped to the wood.
